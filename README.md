# Hi, I'm bones

I'm a happy little skeleton. You can clone me to use as a starter on your projects!
I have React, Redux, Sequelize, and Express all just rattling around in here ready
to go.

## I need node >= 6.7.0

If you don't have it, I'll complain and tell you how to install it.

## 1. Make me into something!

We recommend that you **clone**, not fork, this repo – unless your intention is
to develop Bones proper instead of using Bones as the starting point for your
own application.

Start by doing either of the following:

* Create a GitHub repo and clone it, or
* `git init` in an empty directory on your machine.

After you have a repo on your machine:

```sh
git remote add bones https://github.com/1706-FSA-NY/bones.git
git fetch bones
git merge bones/master
```

And then you'll have me! If I change – which I probably will – you can get the most recent
version by doing this again:

```sh
git fetch bones
git merge bones/master
```

## 2. I need a name.

I don't have a name. I think I used to have one, but it turned to dust right along with my
heart and liver and pituitary gland and all that stuff.

Anyway, I'll need one. Give me a name in `package.json`.

## 3. Start my dusty heart

Short and sweet:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script sets `NODE_ENV` to "development", runs the build script in watch mode, and
starts the server with `nodemon`. Build vs server logs are separated by a prefix. If you prefer
to run the server and build processes separately, you can instead do:

```sh
npm run start-dev
```

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

In two separate terminals. The vanilla `npm start` is for production — you won't use it in development!

## My anatomy

`/app` has the React/Redux setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/db` has the Sequelize models and database setup. It'll create the database for you if it doesn't exist,
assuming you're using postgres.

`/server` has the Express server and routes. `start.js` is the entry point.

`/bin` has scripts. (Right now it has *one* script that creates a useful symlink.)

## Contribution guide

4. Merge into master (with merge commit)

### Code style guide

- Pay attention to the linter!
- Don't use semicolons
- Two spaces
- Trailing commas where possible
- `const` or `let` over `var`
- Use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files
- Use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code
- Put import statements at top
- Put the default export at bottom
- Consider splitting up any file larger than 50 lines
- Define container components and presentational components in separate files
- Use the ["ducks" pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for redux
- Name files using lowercase-and-dashes instead of camelCase or PascalCase, except for when the default export is a class, then use PascalCase
- Define react components as pure functions (instead of classes) whenever possible
